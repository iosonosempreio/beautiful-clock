# Beautiful Clock
A demo repository for demonstrating the GitHub flow and the use of the desktop client to students following the CreativeCoding class at (Polimi)[www.polimi.it]

## The Recipe
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and login (or sign-up).
2. Create a p5js project on your computer.
3. Open GitHub Desktop then **New Repository**, **Add** and locate the folder of your project.
4. Make your first commit (usually called "First commit") on the **master** branch.
5. Publish the project on your GitHub account. Now everything is online and backed up.
6. Create a new branch from master (i.e. "work-of-a-designer") and make sure it is selected from the drop-down menu.
> A branch is like a copy of the master branch where you can experiment without fear of irreparably damage your project. Once you're done with new improvements you can merge your code to the master in order to maintain an official, stable and updated version of your project.
7. While working and editing your code, sometimes remember to commit them to the new branch. A commit is a sort of milestone: this means that you can save your current stage of the work and you're always able to step back to a previous stage.
8. You'll see this branch is ahead to **master** by 1 commit (or more). You can go on editing your code and everytime you think you reached an meaningful stage you can commit the new changes.
9. Once in a while, but even everytime if this could make you feel more comfortable, remember to sync your local repo with the remote one (the one on github.com). Just hit the **Sync** button while on your personal branch and do the same while on your master and for all the other branches that you want to keep updated and backed up.
